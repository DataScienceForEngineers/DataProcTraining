Cells are run one at a time allowing the user to run and test individual chunks of code. They are useful in data analysis where tasks such as reading in data or training models may take several minutes and you don't want to have to re run all of your code every time you make a change. \n",

When you run a cell, it will usually display the output of the last line of code below the cell. In this notebook, we change the setting so that the output of every line is displayed for demonstration purposes. \n",
