# Welcome to DataProcTraining!

Here you will learn the basic skills you need to work with datafiles using Python Pandas. The trainings are spilt into four different modules with content as follows:

## Module 1 - Data Wrangling 
* Understanding different file types
* How to use Jupyter notebooks
* Reading in files using pandas 
* Viewing, accessing, and editing DataFrames
* Sorting and segmenting DataFrames 

## Module 2 - Data Visualization  
* Graphing in Matplotlib
    * Scatter Plots
    * Line Graphs
    * Histograms 

## Module 3 - Linear Regression
* Building Multilinear models 
* Transforming variables for better fit 
* Model selection based on multicollinearity
* Model interpretation 

## Module 4 - Decision Trees
* The importance of interpretable models 
* Decision tree basics 
* Tuning Decision trees 

# Getting Started 

To being accessing content, either download the module you are interested in to run the code yourself, or follow along with our youtube playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtJDAsRJ-IYHWHbX6bFyExP7JtqNoy-xj.

Each module contains one Juypter Notebook and one or more data files. Running the code in this repository requires access to a Jupyter Notebook server. You can access one online via Google Colab, or run one on your own computer using VS code. Google Colab is a quick way to get started, but running the code on your own machine will allow you more control over your files. 

## Google Colab 
See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3sKKvMCwTo&ab_channel=UnitedTopTech for how to upload a Jupyter Notebook to Google Colab and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsiU1T1PMBA&ab_channel=TheHowToCow for how to load in the datasets included in each module. 

## VS Code
To run the notebooks on your own device, download a module and open the folder in VS Code (make sure to have Python installed). Keeping the whole module together in one folder will ensure you can access the appropriate data files. 

If you have never used python or VS Code before, this video will walk you through everything you need from installing Python to managing your packages using uv https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUAJ1WoGsFk&ab_channel=flocode. Otherwise, follow the instructions in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suAkMeWJ1yE&ab_channel=VisualStudioCode to set a up Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code.
